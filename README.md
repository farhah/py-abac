# py-ABAC
Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) SDK for python. 

## Introduction

This document describes the Policy Language (PL) implemented in **pyabac** for defining policies as part of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC). The goal of PL is to provide a simplified JSON-based language to create Policies for access control. 

## Access Control Architecture

ABAC comes with a recommended architecture which is as follows:

1. The PEP or Policy Enforcement Point: it is responsible for protecting the apps & data you want to apply ABAC to. The PEP inspects the user request and generates an authorization request which it sends to the PDP.
2. The PDP or Policy Decision Point is the brain of the architecture. This is the piece which evaluates incoming requests against policies it has been configured with. The PDP returns a Permit / Deny decision. The PDP may also use PIPs to retrieve missing metadata
3. The PIP or Policy Information Point bridges the PDP to external sources of attributes e.g. LDAP or databases. This is yet not supported in **pyabac**.
4. The PAP or Policy Administration Point: manages the creation, update and deletion of policies. 

## Access Control Elements

In most if not every access control protocol, the following four elements are involved:

1. `subject`: This is the entity which requests access, also known as the request principal. A subject can be anything that requests access, i.e. a user or an application.
2. `resource`: The object which is requested to be accessed by the subject. 
3. `action`: The action being performed on the resource.
4. `context`: This element deals with time, location or dynamic aspects of the access control scenario. 

In **pyabac** one defines policies containing conditions on one or more attributes of these four elements. If these conditions are satisfied, an access decision is returned by the PDP using an evaluation algorithm. Thus with ABAC you can have as many policies as you like that cater to many different scenarios and technologies. There are three different evaluation algorithms supported by **pyabac**:

1. `AllowOverrides`: PDP returns *allow* if any decision evaluates to *allow*; and returns *deny* if all decisions evaluate to *deny*.
2. `DenyOverrides`: PDP returns *deny* if any decision evaluates to *deny*; returns *allow* if all decisions evaluate to *allow*.
3. `HighestPriority`: PDP returns the highest priority decision that evaluates to either *allow* or *deny*. If there are multiple equally highest priority decisions that conflict, then `DenyOverrides` algorithm would be applied among those highest priority decisions.

## Policy Language

We now present the policy language used by **pyabac**. This section is divided into two subsections. The first subsection discusses JSON-based definition of a policy, while the latter about that authorization request. 

### Policy

A policy object consists of id, description, conditions, targets, effect, and priority fields. The JSON schema of this object is given by

```json
{   
    "id": <string>,  
    "description": <string>,   
    "conditions": <conditions_block>,   
    "targets": <targets_block>,   
    "effect": <string>,   
    "priority": <number> 
}
```

where <conditions_block> and `<targets_block>` are JSON blocks explained in the following sections. The `"id"` field is a string value that uniquely identifies a policy. The `"description"` stores description of the policy provided by the policy creator. The two fields `"conditions"` and `"targets"` indicate the attributes of the access control elements to which the policy apply. The `"effect"` is the returned decision of the policy and can be either *allow* or *deny*. Finally, `"priority"` provides a numeric value indicating the weight of the policy when its decision conflicts with other policy under the `HighestPriority` evaluation algorithm. By default, this field is set to `0` for all policies.

#### Conditions Block

Conditions are Boolean expressions defined on the attributes of the access control elements. This block consists of fields subject, resource, action and context, where for each field a Boolean expression is defined on their attributes. The JSON schema is given by

```json
{   
    "subject": <boolean_expression>,   
    "resource": <boolean_expression>,   
    "action": <boolean_expression>,   
    "context": <boolean_expression> 
} 
```

with `<boolean_expression>` being a JSON block for Boolean expression.

A policy is considered applicable only when each of the Boolean expressions are satisfied. These expressions are constraints on the attribute values of the field for which they are defined. These constraints can be simple, involving only a single attribute, or can be complex consisting of multiple attributes. A simple Boolean expression consists of a key-value pair as shown below:

```json
{"<attribute_path>": <condition_expression>}
```

The key specifies an attribute path in *ObjectPath* format while the value is a condition expression. The condition expression is a JSON block specifying specifically the requirements that the attribute value needs to meet. The different supported condition expressions by **pyabac** are shown in Appendix. As an example, the condition block for the requirement that name attribute of subject field should be Max is shown below:

```json
{
    "subject": {     
        "$.name": {       
            "condition": "Eq",       
            "value": "Max"     
        }   
    } 
}
```

Sometimes condition on a single attribute does not suffice and constraints on multiple attributes connected by logical relations like AND or OR are required. In **pyabac** this is achieved by using JSON’s in-built data structures, *object* and *array*, as implicit logical operators. An *object* is implicitly an AND operator which would be evaluated to true only if all the included key-value pairs are evaluated to true. Similarly, an *array* is implicitly a OR operator which would be evaluated to true as long as at least one of its members is evaluated to true. This is illustrated in the following condition block:

```json
{   
    "subject": {     
        "$.firstName": {       
            "condition": "Eq",
            "value": "Carl"
        }
    },   
    "$.lastName": {     
        "condition": "Eq",     
        "value": "Rubin"   
    },   
    "resource": [     
        {       
            "$.name": {         
                "condition": "Eq",         
                "value": "Default"       
            }     
        },     
        {       
            "$.type": {         
                "condition": "Eq",         
                "value": "Book"       
            }     
        }   
    ] 
}
```

The condition states that the subject should have an attribute `firstName` as "Carl" AND `lastName` as "Rubin". Similarly, the resource should have an attribute name as "Default" OR type as "Book".

#### Targets Block

The primary purpose of targets block is to define for which elements the policy applies. The block contains an implicit logical OR operation on ‘ID’ attribute of the subject, resource, and action fields. This enables an efficient retrieval of policies from a repository by PDP. Thus in **pyabac**, it is required that these access elements have a string valued ID attribute. The JSON schema of the block is given by

```json
{   
    "subject_id": [<id_string>, <id_string>, … ],   
    "resource_id": [<id_string>, <id_string>, … ],   
    "action_id": [<id_string>, <id_string>, … ] 
} 
```

where <id_string> are the required string values for the ‘ID’ attribute. Regex values for <id_string> are also allowed. An example target block is shown below:

```json
{   
    "subject_id": ["a", "b"],   
    "resource_id": ["ab.*"],   
    "action_id": [".*"] 
}
```

This target block defines that the policy is only applicable if the subject ID is either set to “a” or “b”, and the resource ID starts with string “ab”. The action can have any ID value. 

If a target block is not explicitly specified, the policy is considered to be always applicable as the following default is used: 

```json
{   
    "subject_id": [".*"],   
    "resource_id": [".*"],   
    "action_id": [".*"] 
}
```

### Authorization Request

An authorization request is a data object sent by PEP to PDP. This object contains all the information needed by the PDP to evaluate the policies and return access decision. The JSON schema of the object is given by

```json
{   
    "subject": {     
        "id": <string>,     
        "attributes": <attribute_block>   
    },   
    "resource": {     
        "id": <string>,     
        "attributes": <attribute_block>   
    },   
    "action": {     
        "id": <string>,     
        "attributes": <attribute_block>   
    },   
    "context": <attribute_block> 
}
```

where `<attribute_block>` is just a JSON block containing one or more attribute-value pairs. An example request is shown below:

```json
{
  "subject": {
    "id": "a",
    "attributes": {
      "firstName": "Carl",
      "lastName": "Right"
    }
  },
  "resource": {
    "id": "a",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Calendar"
    }
  },
  "action": {
    "id": "",
    "attributes": {}
  },
  "context": {}
}
```
